          <h2 id="Grandp">GRANDPARENTS</h2>
          <p class="upsize">The importance of grandparents, why are grandparents so important to the development of children in general? That is a very board question to answer, I definitely won’t be able to answer that question adequately, but I will indeed give my views on the Importance of them.</p>

          <h3 id="sub">My view point</h3>
          <p class="upsize">Generally speaking, grandparents play an indirect role in their grandchildren’s lives, in my case, this wasn’t true they played a direct role by raising me themselves. So, this would bring me to my first point:</p>
            <br />
            <dl>
              <ul>
                <dt><li class="reasons"><h3>Selfless:</h3></li></dt>
                <dd class="upsize">This should be self-explanatory, but in case it’s not they were selfless as soon as they decided to adopt me and take care of me due to the failure of my parents taking responsibility.</dd>
                
                <dt><li class="reasons"><h3>Wisdom/experience:</h3></li></dt>
                <dd class="upsize">So, I think another major factor came down to experience, my grandparents had the knowledge and wisdom to react to certain situations that I think parents wouldn’t be able to deal with as efficiently. I think they built a great structure around dealing with all my transgressions as well as my triumphs.</dd>
                
                <dt><li class="reasons"><h3>Relationships:</h3></li></dt>
                <dd class="upsize">Although my early experiences on the idea of love and relationships were horrific thanks to the devastating relationship got to see between my actual parents. Thankfully to my grandparents, I got to realize what a healthy relationship looked like.<br /><br /> Watching the commitment and love between my grandparents was second to none. I learnt mainly from my grandfather that it’s okay to bite your tongue and not retaliate many times my grandfather decided not to say anything and just accept it for the greater good. By no stress of the imagination was it all smooth sailing from there on out. When my grandfather chose not to retaliate and take the silent root, it frustrated my grandmother. Which was quite amusing for me at least.<br /><br /> What I learnt from my grandmother was it’s sometimes necessary to bring up issues even though there is a possibility to it leading to an argument because it wasn’t rooted in evil but in love, as sometimes we need a loved one to point out certain things that are issues as we sometimes personally rationalize certain things to make them easier. With all this being said the bond between my grandparents was amazing to see and experience.</dd>
               
                <dt><li class="reasons"><h3>Memories:</h3></li></dt>
                <dd class="upsize">I have amazing memories of my childhood with my grandparents from my grandmother playing badminton and cards with me to my grandfather just finishing work and arriving back home exhausted from a long day and still didn’t hesitate to say yes when I asked him to play cricket or soccer with me. From our dinner around the table to my grandmother always making sure I had lunch packed for the following day of school. There are so many fond memories.</dd>
              </ul>
            </dl>
            <br />
          <p class="upsize">I think it is just best to leave it here with my final thought and that is without my grandparents I would not be where I am today nor would I be the person I am. I will always be appreciative and thankful for having the experience of going up with them like they were my parents. There is nothing I could do to ever repay them for their selflessness and love. I love my grandparents.</p>
